# Hey

Here's what I did when I was bored.
It's a <ins>***password generator***</ins>.

## How to use

1. Open the html file named "index".
2. Choose your language.
3. Insert the number of characters that your password must make.
4. Press the button.
5. Your password appears. *Nice*

Don't ask me why I did this...

Have a nice day.
